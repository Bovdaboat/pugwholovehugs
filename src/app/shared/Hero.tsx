            <p>Once upon a time, in a cozy little house, lived two adorable pug sisters named TsuNami and Stella.
                These two little furballs were inseparable. From the moment they were born, they formed an unbreakable
                bond that only grew stronger with time. Stella, the older sister, was a playful and adventurous pug with
                a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. TsuNami, the younger one, was a gentle and affectionate soul, always
                seeking comfort in her sister's presence. They spent their days frolicking in the backyard, chasing
                each other's tails, and exploring the world together.
